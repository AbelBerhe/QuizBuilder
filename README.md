This Quiz Builder App was created for a school project. This app allows users to load terms and definitions from a file and display them in an organized and clear manner. Users are then given a set of options for each definition, and they must choose the correct option to earn points. It keeps track of the user's progress and displays the quiz results at the end. This application was created using XML and Java.
